# the_hangman_project
A guessing game in which one player attempts to guess the letters of a word; failing attempts are recorded by drawing a gallows and someone hanging from it, line by line.

This is my very first project using a combination of loops, if/else statements, inputs, emoji icons. Random select was inserted to randomize various selected words for every new attempt.

Enjoy.
